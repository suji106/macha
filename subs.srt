Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

earns a lot of threats.

spend your life with.

there's a lot of windows up here.

841
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:57,808
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

842

...and to the protection
of his community.

843
01:01:00,435 --> 01:01:02,229
I remember when I first took office...

844
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:04,940
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

845
01:01:05,107 --> 01:01:10,362
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

846
01:01:14,116 --> 01:01:17,286
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

847
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:21,957
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

848
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:25,377
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

849
01:01:29,756 --> 01:01:31,425
- Who's that?
- What happened?

850
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:34,344

is the price of safety.

855

Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

992

<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

993
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,712
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

994
01:11:10,879 --> 01:11:12,338
Do we really think he's gonna...?

995

than the lives of citizens?

The Batman is an outlaw.

997
01:11:19,304 --> 01:11:23,057
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

clean up our streets till now.
