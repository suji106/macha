Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest
Hey Wuertz mayor says

The investigation is ongoing
 The process of cleaning u
the streets is a long one

This bank was another drop for the Mob

 We found the bulk of their dirty cash
 Time to move in
Wed have to hit all banks simultaneously
SWAT teams backup
What about this Joker guy
One man or the entire Mob He can wait
When the new DA hears about this
hell want in
 Do you trust him
 Be hard to keep him out
I hear hes as stubborn as you are

Be nice when Wayne Manors rebuilt
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse
for not sleeping in a mansion
Whenever you stitch yourself up
you do make a bloody mess
Yeah It makes me learn
from my mistakes
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now then
My armor
Im carrying too much weight
I need to be I need to be faster
Im sure Mr Fox can oblige
 Did you get mauled by a tiger
 It was a dog
 Huh
 It was a big dog
There were more copycats last night
Alfred with guns
Why not hire them
take the weekend off
That wasnt exactly
what I had in mind
 when I said I wanted to inspire people
 I know
But things have improved
Look at the new district attorney

I am closely
Need to know if he can be trusted
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business
I trust you dont have me followed
on my day off
If you ever took one I might
Know your limits Master Wayne
Batman has no limits
 Well you do sir
 Well cant afford to know them
And whats gonna happen
on the day that you find out
We all know how much you like to say
I told you so
On that day Master Wayne
even I wont want to
Probably

Sorry Im late folks
 Where were you
 Worried youd have to step up
 Harvey I know these briefs backwards
 Well then
fairs fair
Heads Ill take it Tails hes all yours
Yeah You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads
My fathers lucky coin As I recall
it got me my first date with you
I wouldnt leave something like that
up to chance
I dont I make my own luck
All rise
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor
30 More than enough tim
to put you away for life Sally
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham
someone must have stepped up
to run the socalled family
Is that man in this courtroom today
 Could you identify him for us please
 You win counselor
It was me
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man
Salvatore Maroni is the new head
of the Falcone crime family
Maroni Hes a fall guy
Im the brains of the organization
Order
 Permission to treat the witness as hostile
 Granted
 Hostile Ill show you hostile
Carbon fiber 28 caliber made in China
If you wanna kill a public servant
Mr Maroni I recommend you buy American
Get him out of here
 But Your Honor Im not done
Well never be able to link the gun
to Maroni so we cant charge him
But theyre trying to kill you
means were getting to them
Im glad youre so pleased Rachel
Im fine by the way
Come on Harvey Youre Gothams DA
Youre not getting shot at
youre not doing your job right
But you know
if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day off
Cant I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here
Oh Jim Gordon Hes a friend actually
Try to be nice
I hear you got a hell of a right cross
Its a shame Sals going to walk
Yeah well good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances
Lightly irradiated bills
Fancy stuff for a city cop Have help
We liaise with various agencies
Save it Gordon I wanna meet him
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight
Mmhm What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment
I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance counselor
Ive put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars
but the Mob
is still getting its money out
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town
Youre trying to hit them
where it hurts their wallets
Its bold
You gonna count me in
In this town the fewer people know
something the safer the operation
I dont like that you got
your own special unit
and its full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs
If I didnt work with cops
youd investigated while at IA
Id be working alone
I dont get political points for being an idealist
I do the best I can with what I have
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks
without telling me what were after
I can give you the names of the banks
Well thats a start
Ill get you your warrants
but I want your trust
Oh you dont have to sell me Dent
We all know youre Gothams white knight
Yeah well I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU
I wouldnt know about that
In China Lau Security Investment
stands for dynamic new growth
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse

Well Mr Lau
I speak for the rest of the board
and Mr Wayne
in expressing our own excitement
Sir I know Mr Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished
but frankly this is embarrassing
You worry about the diligence
Mr Reese
Ill worry about Bruce Wayne
Its done
The numbers are solid
Do them again
Wouldnt want the trust fund to run out
now would we

Another long night
This joint venture was your idea
and the consultants love it
But Im not convinced
Laus company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork
His revenue stream
must be off the books
maybe even illegal
Okay Cancel the deal
You already knew
Just needed a closer look at their books
Anything else you can trouble me for
I need a new suit
Yeah Three buttons
is a little 90s Mr Wayne
Im not talking fashion Mr Fox
so much as function
You wanna be able to turn your head
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier
Ill see what I can do
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here
I had to tell them
I work for the government
 Really
 Health inspectors not afraid to pull strings
Rachel Fancy that
Yeah Bruce Fancy that
Rachel Natascha Natascha Rachel
 Natascha Are you the prima
 Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet
 Wow Harveys taking me next week
 Really So youre into ballet
Bruce This is Harvey Dent
The famous Bruce Wayne
Rachels told me everything about you
I certainly hope not
 Lets put a couple tables together
 Im not sure that theyll let us
Oh they should I own the place
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this
 Well I was raised here I turned out okay
 Is Wayne Manor in the city limits
Is Hehheh
The Palisades Sure
You know as our new DA you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends
Im talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for whats right
Gotham needs heroes like you
elected officials
 not a man who thinks hes above the law
 Who appointed the Batman
We did All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city

But this is a democracy Harvey

When their enemies were at the gates
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city
It wasnt considered an honor
it was a public service
Harvey the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar
 and he never gave up his power
 Okay fine
You either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
Whoever the Batman is he doesnt
wanna do this for the rest of his life
How could he Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle

Someone like you Mr Dent
Maybe If Im up to it
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader Hm
If I were sneaking out every night
someone wouldve noticed by now
Well Im sold Dent
and Im gonna throw you a fundraiser
Thats nice but Im not
up for reelection for three years
No you dont understand
One fundraiser with my pals
youll never need another cent
BEEPING AND WHINING
What the hell is this
As youre all aware
one of our deposits was stolen
A relatively small amount 68 million
Whos stupid enough to steal from us
Twobit wackjob
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup
Hes not the problem Hes a nobody
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops
Thanks to Mr Maronis
wellplaced sources
we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills
and are planning to
seize your funds today
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business
 Im your only option
So what are you proposingi
 Moving all deposits t
one secure location not a bank
 Where then
 No one can know but me
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you
everyones money would be at stake
What stop them getting to you
far from Dents jurisdiction
I go to Hong Kong
and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own
i
How soon can you move the money
i
I already have
For obvious reasons I couldnt wait
for your permission
Rest assured your money is safe
Oh heehee aha
Ha ooh hee haha haha
And I thought my jokes were bad
Give me one reason why I shouldnt
have my boy pull your head off
How about a magic trick
Im gonna make this pencil disappear
Tada
Its
Its gone
Oh and by the way
the suit it wasnt cheap
 You ought to know you bought it
Sit
I want to hear proposition

Lets wind the clocks back a year
These cops and lawyers
wouldnt dare cross any of you
I mean what happened
Did your balls drop off Hm
You see a guy like me
 A freak
Damn right
A guy like me Look listen
I know why you choose
to have your little ahem
grouptherapy sessions
in broad daylight
I know why youre afraid
to go out at night
The Batman
See Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors unfortunately
Dent hes just the beginning
And as for the televisions
socalled plan
Batman has no jurisdiction
Hell find him and make him squeal
I know the squealers when I see them
and

What do you propose
Its simple We uh kill the Batman
If its so simple why havent
you done it already
If youre good at something
never do it for free
How much you want
Uh half
Youre crazy
 No Im not
No Im not
If we dont deal with this now
soon
little Gambol here wont be able
to get a nickel for his grandma
Enough from the clown
Ah tatata Lets not blow
Shit
 this out of proportion
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away
 Yeah
Im putting the word out
Five hundred grand for this clown dead
A million alive so I can teach him
some manners first
All right So listen
why dont you give me a call
when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously
Heres my card
Mmmm
Youre a hard man to reach
Laus halfway to Hong Kong
If youd have asked
I could have taken his passport
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills
They knew we were coming
As soon as your office got involved
My office
Youre sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and youre talking
Oh yeah I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat
Dont try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maronis got people in your office Dent
We need Lau back
but the Chinese wont extradite
a national under any circumstances
If I get him to you
can you get him to talk
Ill get him to sing
Were going after the Mobs life savings
Things will get ugly
I knew the risk when I took this job
lieutenant
How will you get him back any
He does that
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off
Well Im sure that youve always wanted
to go to Hong Kong
Whats wrong with a phone call
I think Mr Lau deserves
a more personal touch
Now for highaltitude jumps your
going to need oxygen and stabilizers
Well I must say
compared to your usual requests
jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward

What about getting back into the plane
 Id recommend a good travel agent
 Without it landing
Now thats more like it Mr Wayne
The CIA had a program back in the 60s
for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook
 We could look into that
 Yeah
Okay Now
Hardened Kevlar plates over titaniumdipped
triweave fibers for flexibility
Youll be lighter faster more agile
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first
 Yeah
 Now there is a tradeoff
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire
We wouldnt wanna make things
too easy now would we
How will it hold up against dogs
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas
Should do fine against cats
I found one in Arizona
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he takes cash
 What about the flight crew
 South Korean smugglers
They run flights into Pyongyang
below radar
 Did you think of an alibi
 Oh yes
I believe this is your plane sir
You look tired Alfred
Youll be all right without me
If you can tell me the Russian for
apply your own bloody suntan lotion
Yo Gambol somebody here for you
They say theyve just killed the Joker

They brought the body
So dead thats 500
How about alive Hm
You wanna know how I got these scars
My father was
a drinker
and a fiend
And one night
he goes off crazier than usual
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself
He doesnt like that
not one bit
So me watching
he takes the knife to her
laughing while he does it

Why so serious
He comes at me with the knife
Why so serious
He sticks the blade in my mouth
Lets put a smile on that face
And
Why so serious
Now
our operation is small
but there is a lot of potential
for aggressive expansion
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team
Oh Theres only one spot open right now
so were gonna have
tryouts
Make it fast

Welcome to Hong Kong Mr Fox
Mr Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today

I understand
For security purposes Im gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile
Of course
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force
 I couldnt let it threaten my company
 Of course
A businessman of your stature
will understand and
with you here now we can continue
Well I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style Mr Lau but I re
We do not allow cell phones in here
Im sorry Forgot I had it
No I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold
You see we cant afford
to be seen to do business with
whatever it is youre accused of being
Im sure a businessman of your stature
will understand
I think Mr Fox a simple phone call
might have sufficed
Mr Wayne didnt want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time
Just accidentally wasting it
Thats very good Mr Lau
Accidentally Very good
Hey sir
Theres a better view from the peak tram
Hows the view from LSI Holdings
Restricted
Lau is holed up in there good and tight
 Whats this
 I had R  D work it up
Sends out a highfrequency pulse
records the response time
for mapping an environment
Sonar Just like a
Submarine Mr Wayne Like a submarine
 And the other device
 Its in place
MT Wayne
Good luck
Look give us the mone
and well talk about making a deal
The money is the only reason
Im still alive
Oh you mean when they find out that
youve helped us theyre gonna kill you
 Are you threatening my client
 No
Im just assuming your clients
cooperation with this investigation
As will everyone
No Okay
Enjoy your time in County Mr Lau

Wait
I wont give you the money
but I will give you my clients
all of them
You were a glorified accountant
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge
Im good with calculation
I handled all their investments
One big pot
Got it
One minute
RICO If they pooled their money we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy
Charge them with what
In a RICO case if you can charge
one of them with a felony
You can charge all of them with it
Thats great
Mr Lau
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund
 Ledgers
 Immunity protection
 a chartered plane back to Hong Kong
 After you testify in open court
Im just curious
With all your clients locked up
whats gonna happen
with all that money
Like I said Im good with calculation
He cant go to County
Ill keep him here in the holding cells
What is this Gordon your fortress
Well you trust them over at County
I dont trust them here
Lau stays
Well I dont know about Mr Laus travel
arrangements but Im sure glad hes back
Put word out We hire the clown
He was right
We have to fix real problem
Batman
 Im not aware of any participation
 Our boy looks good on the tube
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends
Oh dont worry Theyre coming too

Have a nice trip See you next fall
i
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion
Eight hundred and fortynine
counts of racketeering
Two hundred and fortysix counts of fraud
Eightyseven counts of conspiracy murder
Five hundred and twentyseven
counts of obstruction of justice
How do the defendants plead
Order in the court
 Five hundred and fortynin
criminals at once
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce
She shares my enthusiasm for justice
After all she is a judge
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo
youre gonna set
a new record at appeals
It wont matter
The head guys make bail sure
But the midlevel guys they cant
They cant afford to be off the streets
Theyll cut deals that include some jail time
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets
Mr Mayor you cant
 No get out Both of you
Sit down
The public likes you
Thats the only reason that this might fly
But that means its on you
Theyre all gonna come after you now
and not just the Mob
Politicians journalists cops
Anyone whose wallets
about to get lighter
Are you up to it Youd better be
Because they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the
streets followed swiftly by you and me
Jesus
I think your fundraise
will be a great success sir
And why do you think I wann
hold a party for Harvey Dent
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself

To try to impress Miss Dawes
Very droll but very wrong
Actually its Dent
ON TV Police release
video footage found concealed on the body
Sensitive viewers be aware
The image is disturbing
i
Tell them your name
Brian Douglas
i
And are you the real Batman
No
No
 No
 No
Then why do you dress up like him
Whoohoohoohoo
 Because hes a symbol that w
dont have to be afraid of scum like you
 Yeah You do Brian You really doi
Huh Yeah Oh shh shh shh
So you think Batmans
made Gotham a better place Hm
 Look at mei
Look at me
You see this is how crazy
Batmans made Gotham
You want order in Gotham
Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in
Oh and every day he doesnt
people will die
Starting tonight
 Im a man of my wordi
Harvey Dent
scourge of the underworld
scared stiff by the trustfund brigade
 Ill be back
 Rachel
A little liquid courage Mr Dent
 Thank you Alfred right
 Thats right sir
Rachel talks about you all the time
Youve known her her whole life
Not yet sir
Any psychotic exboyfriends
I should be aware of
Oh you have no idea
Im sorry that Im late Im gla
to see that you all got started without me
Now where is Harvey Where
Harvey Dent the man of the hour
Wheres Rachel Dawes
She is my oldest friend Come here
When Rachel first told me she was dating

The guy from those Godawful
campaign commercials
I believe in Harvey Dent
Yeah nice slogan Harvey
But it caught Rachels attention
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey
and all that hes been doing
as our new DA
And you know what
I believe in Harvey Dent
I believe that on his watch
Gotham can feel
a little safer a
little more optimistic
Look at this face This is the face
of Gothams bright future
To Harvey Dent Lets hear it for him

Harvey
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand youre making fun of him
 but I do
 No I meant every word
You know that day
that you once told me about
when Gotham would no longer
need Batman
 Its coming
 Bruce
 You cant ask me to wait for that
 Its happening now Harvey is that hero
He locked up half of the citys criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask
Gotham needs a hero with a face
You can throw a party Wayne
Ill give you that
Thanks again
You mind if I borrow Rachel
Lieutenant that joker card pinned to the
body Forensics found three sets of DNA
 Any matches
 All three
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb
The Jokers telling us who hes targeting
Get a unit over to Surrillos house
Tell Wuertz to find Dent
Protective custody
Wheres the commissioner
 City hall
 Seal the building
 No one in or out till I get there
 Got it
Gordon What are you up to
Were secure I want a floorbyfloor
search of the entire building
We believe the Jokers
made a threat against your life
These are dangerous people
 Youre not giving me a lot of information
 Even we dont know where youre going
Take the envelope get in open it
Itll tell you where youre headed
You cant leave me alone
with these people
The whole Mobs after you
and youre worried about these guys
Compared to this
the Mob doesnt scare me
Gordon youre unlikely to discover this
for yourself so
take my word the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly
Yeah I bet
Yeah It makes you think about things
you couldnt stand losing
about who you wanna
spend your life with
 Thats a pretty big commitment
 Not if the Mob has their way
You get to explain to my wife
why Im late for dinner
Sir the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it
 Dont do that
 All right
 Lets be serious then
 Okay
Whats your answer
I dont have an answer
Howd they get my DNA
Somebody with access
to your office or house
must have lifted a tissue
or a glass Wait Wait
 Well I guess no answer is a no
 Harvey
 Its someone else isnt it
 Harvey
Just tell me its not Wayne
The guys a complete f
What are you doing

Oh shit

Get a medic
Theyve come for him
We made it
Stay hidden
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
We are tonights entertainment

Where is Harvey Dent
You know where Harvey is
You know who he is

Hands up pretty boy
Do you know where I can find Harvey
I need to talk to him
Just something little huh No
Whats going on out there Wayne
 Oh thank God youve got a panic room
Hey wait
Oh you gotta be kidding me
You know Ill settle for his loved ones
Were not intimidated by thugs
You know
you remind me of my father
I hated my father

Okay stop
Well hello beautiful
You must be Harveys squeeze Hm
And you are beautiful
You look nervous Is it the scars
You wanna know how I got them
Come here Hey
Look at me
So I had a wife
She was beautiful like you
who tells me I worry too much
who tells me I ought to smile more
who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks Hey
One day they carve her face
And we have no money for surgeries
She cant take it
I just wanna see her smile again Hm
I just want her to know
that I dont care about the scars
So
I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this
to myself
And you know what
She cant stand the sight of me
She leaves
Now I see the funny side
Now Im always smiling
You got a little fight in you I like that

Then youre gonna love me
Drop the gun
Oh sure You just take off your little mas
and show us all who you really are Hm
Let her go
Very poor choice of words
Are you all right
Lets not do that again
 Is Harvey okay
 Hes safe
Thank you
Jim its over
As long as they dont get to Lau
weve cut off their funds
The prosecutions over
Nobodys standing up in front of a judge
while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away
 What about Dent
 Hes got any sense Dents halfway to Mex

So where do you keep your trash
Youre due in court I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record
You cant protect me
You cant even protect yourselves
You refuse to cooperate youre not
coming back here you go to County
How long do you calculate
youll last in there
Targeting me wont get their money
I knew the Mob wouldnt go down easily
 but this is different They crossed a line
 You crossed the line first
You squeezed them you hammered them
to the point of desperation
And in their desperation they turned to
a man they didnt fully understand
Criminals arent complicated Alfred
We just need to figure out
what hes after

With respect Master Wayne
perhaps this is a man
you dont fully understand either
A long time ago I was in Burma
and my friends and I were working
for the local government
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders
by bribing them with precious stones
but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit
So we went looking for the stones
But in six months we never
met anyone who traded with him
One day I saw a child
playing with a ruby
the size of a tangerine
The bandit had been
throwing them away
 So why steal them
 Because he thought it was good sport
Because some men arent looking
for anything logical like money
They cant be bought bullied
reasoned or negotiated with
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn
i
Your name sir
 Eighth and Orchard
Youll find Harvey Dent there

Check the names
Richard Dent
Patrick Harvey
Harvey Dent
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it
 Its because of you these guys are dead
 Detective
Give us a minute guys
Thats brick underneath
 Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet
 No
Fingerprints
Whatever youre gonna do do it fast
Because we found his next target
Hes put it in tomorrows paper
Im not sure
you made it loud enough sir
What can I do for you Mr Reese
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again
Well I found some irregularities
Their CEO is in police custody
No not with their numbers with yours
Applied Sciences Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files
Dont tell me you didnt recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news
Now you got the entire R  D Department
burning through cash
claiming its related to
cell phones for the Army
What are you building for him now
a rocket ship
I want
10 million a year
for the rest of my life
Let me get this straight
You think that your client
one of the wealthiest most powerful men
in the world is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands
and your plan
is to blackmail this person
Good luck
When
Keep that

This is your original scan
Here it is reengineered
And theres the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip
Ill get you a copy
Mr Wayne did you reassign R  D
Yeah Government
telecommunications project
Wasnt aware
we had any government contracts
You know Lucius Im playing this one
pretty close to the chest
Fair enough
With no word from the Batman
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb
these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat
in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor
Ive checked all the databases
There are four possibles
Crossreference the addresses
Look for Parkside
overlooking the parade
I got one
Melvin White
1502 Randolph Apartments
Aggravated assault
moved to Arkham twice
What do you got on the roof
Were tight but frankly
theres a lot of windows up here
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement
and to the protection
of his community
I remember when I first took office
and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner
And he said he would provided
I kept my politics out of his office
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters
 Whos that
 What happened
They took our guns
And our uniforms
And as we recognize the sacrific
of this man
we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety
Stand by Honor guard
Attention Port arms
Ready Aim Fire
Ready Aim
Ready Aim

Stay down Dont move

Mr Mayor Get him out of here
 Ill see you later
 Why are you going back
Get out of here
Tell me what you know about the Joker
No
Im sorry Barbara
Jimmy go play with your sister
Go ahead honey
If theres anything we can do
anything you need were here for you
Shh

Are you out there
Are you You brought this
craziness on us You did
You brought this on us
Switch it off he aint coming
He doesnt wanna talk to us
God help whoever he does wanna talk to
Cant we go someplace quieter
We cant hear each other talk
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk
What
 Yeah
Second
Okay
 Harvey where are you
Where are youi
Im where you should be at Major Crimes
Im trying to deal with all of this mess
 Can I get the fingerprint analysis
 Rachel listen Youre not safe there
 This is Gordons unit
 Gordons gone
He vouched for these men
 And hes gone
The Jokers named you next
God is there someone is there anyone
in this town we can trust
Bruce
We can trust Bruce Wayne
 No Rachel I know youre his
friend but Harvey trust me
Bruces penthouse is now
the safest place in the city
Then you go straight there
Dont tell anybody
and Ill find you there
I love you
I want the Joker
From one professional to another
youre trying to scare somebody
pick a better spot
From this height
the fall wouldnt kill me
 Im counting on it
 Huh
 Where is he
 I dont know where he is He found us
He must have friends
Friends Have you met this guy
Someone knows where he is
Nobodys gonna tell you nothing
Theyre wise to your act
You got rules
The Joker hes got no rules
Nobodys gonna cross him for you
If you want this guy you got one way
But you already know what that is
Just take off that mask
let him come find you
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind
You wanna play games
Hows that feel
 You wouldnt
 I wouldnt
 You dont think I will
 Mmmm
 You dont think I will
 Mmmm
No No I wouldnt
Thats why Im not
gonna leave it up to me
Heads you get to keep your head
Tails
not so lucky
So you wanna tell me about the Joker
 Lets go again
 I dont know anything God dont
Youre not playing the odds friend
Lets do it again
Youd leave a mans life to chance
 Not exactly
 His names Schiff Thomas
Hes a paranoid schizophrenic
former patient at Arkham
The kind of mind the Joker attracts
What do you expect to learn from him
The Joker killed Gordon
Hes gonna kill Rachel
Youre the symbol of hope
I could never be
Your stand against organized crime
is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades
If anyone saw this
everything would be undone
The criminals you arrested
would be released
and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing
Youre gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow
 Why
 No one else will die because of me
Gothams in your hands now
You cant
You cant give in
You cant give in
Harvey called
He said Batmans gonna turn himself in
I have no choice
You honestly think thats gonna
keep the Joker from killing people
Maybe not But I have enough blood
on my hands
And Ive seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished
that wed be together
Bruce dont make me
your one hope for a normal life
Did you mean it
Yes
Bruce
If you turn yourself in
theyre not gonna let us be together
Logs as well
Everything
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel
People are dying Alfred
What would you have me do
Endure Master Wayne Take it
Theyll hate you for it
but thats the point of Batman
He can be the outcast He can make
the choice that no one else can make
The right choice
No today I found out
what Batman cant do
He cant endure this
Today you get to say I told you so
Today I dont want to
But I did bloody tell you
I suppose theyre gonn
lock me up as well
as your accomplice
Accomplice Im gonna tell the
the whole thing was your idea
Ladies and gentlemen Ive called
this press conference for two reasons
Firstly to assure the citizens
of Gotham
that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done
Secondly because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in
But lets consider the situation
Should we give in
to this terrorists demands
Do we really think hes gonna
Youd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens
The Batman is an outlaw
Thats not why we demand he turn himself
in were doing it because were scared
Weve been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now
Things are worse than ever
Amen
Yes they are
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn
And I promise you
the dawn is coming
One day the Batman will have to answer
for the laws hes broken But to us
not to this madman
 No more dead cops
Yeah
He should turn himself in
Give us the Batman Come on
Where is he
So be it Take the Batman into custody
What
Is he here
I am the Batman
What
Come on

Alfred
Why is he letting Harvey do this
 He went down to the press conference
 I know He just stood by
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr Dent
believe that Batman stands for
something more important
than the whims of a terrorist
Miss Dawes
even if everyone hates him for it
Thats the sacrifice hes making
Hes not being a hero
Hes being something more
Yeah youre absolutely right
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all
You know him better than anyone
I do
Will you give this to him for me
When the time is right
How will I know
Its not sealed
Goodbye Alfred
Bye Rachel
I didnt have time to talk this through
 What are you doing
 Theyre transferring me to Central Holding
This is the Jokers chance and when he
attacks the Batman will take him down
Listen This is too dangerous
We get this guy to County hes their
problem The streets will be cleared
so lets go
The convoys stop for no reason
I hope you got some moves pal
Hes using you as bait He doesnt know if
he can get the Joker Hes failed so far
 How do you know what hes thinking
 I just do Anyway this isnt just about you
What about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and
Harvey Tell everyone the truth
Heads I go through with it
This is your life You cant
leave something like that to chance
Im not
You make your own luck
Hey you wait like everybody else pal
What the hell is that
Obstruction ahead obstruction ahead
Damn it All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth I repeat exit down
Exit down
Lower Fifth Well be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving
Jesus Come on get us out of here
Lets go
Listen we need backup
Weve got company
We got trouble guys
Lock and load
The hell was that
 These are built for that right
 Hell need something
a lot bigger to get through this
What is that
What is that a bazooka

Saving my ass

Let him be Let him be

 Please
 Step away from the bars

My insides hurt
Did Batman save you Daddy
Actually this time
I saved him

Has he said anything yet
Evening commissioner
Harvey Dent never made it home
 Of course not
 What have you done with him
Me
I was right here
Who did you leave him with
Hm Your people
Assuming of course
that they are still your people
and not Maronis
Does it depress you commissioner
to know just how alone you really are
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dents current predicament
 Where is he
 Whats the time
What difference does that make
Well depending on the time
he may be in one spot or several
 If were gonna play games
 Mmhm
Im gonna need a cup of coffee
Ah the good cop bad cop routine
Not exactly
Never start with the head The victi
gets all fuzzy He cant feel the next
See
You wanted me Here I am
OVER SPEAKER
I wanted to see what youd do
And you didnt disappoint
You let five people die
Then you let Dent take your place
 Even to a guy like me thats cold
 Wheres Dent
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were
But I know the truth Theres no going back
Youve changed things
 Forever
 Then why do you wanna kill me
I dont wanna kill you
What would I do without you
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers No no
No No you
You complete me
 Youre garbage who kills for money
 Dont talk like one of them Youre not
Even if youd like to be
To them youre just a freak
like me
They need you right now
but when they dont
theyll cast you out like a leper
You see their morals their code
its a bad joke
Dropped at the first sign of trouble
Theyre only as good as the world
allows them to be Ill show you
When the chips are down these
These civilized people
theyll eat each other
See Im not a monster
Im just ahead of the curve
Wheres Dent
You have all these rules
and you think theyll save you
 Hes in control
 I have one rule
Oh Then thats the rule youll
have to break to know the truth
Which is
The only sensible way to live
is without rules
And tonight youre gonna break
your one rule
Im considering it
Theres only minutes left
so youll have to play my game
if you wanna save one of them
Them
You know for a while there
I thought you really were Dent
The way you threw yourself after her
Look at you go
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny
Where are they
Killing is making a choice
 Where are they
 Choose between one life or the other
Your friend the district attorney
or his blushing bridetobe
You have nothing
nothing to threaten me with
Nothing to do with all your strength
Dont worry Im gonna tell you
where they are both of them

The Joker planned to be caught
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU
i
i
I need to be honest and clear
Im going to marry Harvey Dent
I love him and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman we could be together
I meant it
But now Im sure the day wont come
when you no longer need Batman
I hope it does
And if it does I will be there
but as your friend
Im sorry Harvey
i
Im sorry to let you down
If you lose your faith in me
please keep your faith in people
Love now and always Rachel

Prepared a little breakfast
 Very well then
 Alfred
Yes Master Wayne
Did I bring this on her
I was meant to inspire good
not madness not death
You have inspired good But you spat
in the faces of Gothams criminals
Didnt you think
there might be casualties
Things always get worse
before they get better
But Rachel Alfred
Rachel believed in what you stood for
what we stand for
Gotham needs you
No Gotham needs its true hero
and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell
Which is why for now
theyre gonna have to
make do with you
She was gonna wait for me Alfred
Dent doesnt know
He can never know
Whats that
 It can wait
 That bandit
in the forest in Burma
 Did you catch him
 Yes
How
We burned the forest down
Hes credible an M  A lawyer
from a leading consultancy
He says hes waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing
Now hes taking matters
into his own hands
Well be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman
Im sorry about Rachel
The doctor says youre in agonizing pain
but that you wont accept medication
That youre refusing to
accept skin grafts
Remember that name
you all had for me
when I was at Internal Affairs
What was it Gordon
Harvey I
Say it
Say it
TwoFace Harvey TwoFace
Why should I hide who I am
I know you tried to warn me
Im sorry
Wuertz picked you up
Was he working for them
Do you know who picked up Rachel
Harvey I need to know
which of my men I can trust
Why would you listen to me now
Im sorry Harvey
No

This craziness its too much
Shouldve thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box

You want him
I can tell you
where hell be this afternoon

Not so crazy as you look
I told you Im a man of my word
Where is the Italian
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes

Please
Jokerman what you do
with all your money
You see Im a guy of simple taste
I enjoy
dynamite
and gunpowder
and gasoline
 What the
 Ah ah ah
And you know the thing
that they have in common
Theyre cheap
 ON TV How much are the
paying you to say who Batman is
This is our chance I want Lau alive
The Joker either way
Hey Jim Get a load of this

Lets take the next caller
 Harvey Dent didnt wann
give in to this maniac
You think you know better
I think that if we could talk to
Dent today he may feel differently
And we wish him a speedy recovery
Because God knows we need him now
You said you were a man of your word
Oh I am
Im only burning my half
All you care about is money
This town deserves
a better class of criminal
and Im gonna give it to them
Tell your men they work for me now
This is my city
They wont work for a freak
Freak
cut you up into little pieces
and feed you to your pooches Hm
And then well see how loyal
a hungry dog really is
Its not about money
its about sending a message
Everything burns
 Who is this
I had a visioni
of a world without Batman
The Mob ground out a little profit
and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time
And it was so boring
Ive had a change of heart
I dont want Mr Reese
spoiling everything
but why should I have all the fun
Lets give someone else a chance
If Coleman Reese
isnt dead in 60 minutes
then I blow up a hospital
Call in every officer
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search
Call the transit authority school board
prisons Get every bus down to a hospital
The priority is Gotham General Wheel
everybody out of that place right now
You you and you you come with me
 Where are we going sir
 To get Reese
I need you plugged in
checking Gordons men and their families
 Looking for
 Hospital admissions
Will you be wanting the Batpod
In the middle of the day
Not very subtle
The Lamborghini then
Much more subtle
Excuse me Let me through
Excuse me Okay
Sir could you help please
Im gonna find a bus for him

Sir Commissioner do you really think
an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man

Sir Commissioner
Get the cars around the back
Go Keep rolling Sam
I see OBrien and Richards
No immediate family member

Theyre trying to kill me
 Well maybe Batman can save you
Davis they got space Bring him out

Okay so what now
What do we do now
Where are we going
Send the information to Gordon
Get out of here
Davis
Maam were gonna have to
move him now
Its Berg isnt it
 Commissioner
You okay son
Hi
You know
I dont want there to be
any hard feelings between us Harvey
 When you and
 Rachel
Rachel were being abducted
I was sitting in Gordons cage
I didnt rig those charges
Your men your plan
Do I really look like a guy with a plan
You know what I am
Im a dog chasing cars
I wouldnt know what to do with one
if I caught it
You know I just do things
The Mob has plans The cops have plans
Gordons got plans
You know theyre schemers
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds
Im not a schemer
I try to show the schemers
how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are
So when I say Ah Come here
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal
youll know that Im telling the truth
 Im gonna need your weapon
 What
Why Because my wifes in the hospital
Yeah thatd be why
Its the schemers
that put you where you are
You were a schemer you had plans
and look where that got you
OVER RADIO
Police are taking every precaution
urging people not to
take matters into their hands
I just did what I do best
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets
Hm You know what I noticed
Nobody panics when
things go according to plan
Even if the plan is horrifying
If tomorrow I tell the press that like
a gangbanger will get shot
or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up
nobody panics
Because its all part of the plan
But when I say tha
one little old mayor will die
well then everyone loses their minds
Introduce a little anarchy
upset the established order
and everything becomes chaos
Im an agent of chaos
Oh and you know the thing
about chaos
Its fair
 You live
 Mmhm
You die
Mmm Now were talking
Mr Reese
Thats Mr Wayne isnt it
 That was a very brave thing you did
 Trying to catch the light
 You werent protecting the van
 Why Whos in it
Dont you think
I should go to the hospital
Dont watch a whole lot of news
do you Mr Wayne
Southeast
Its Gotham General
 Did you clear the building
Yeah
You must know how many were inside
You have patient lists roll call
Right now were showing
50 people missing One bus
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals I guess we missed one
Whats your guess
about where Harvey Dent is
Keep looking And keep it to yourself
Anybody asks we got him out

Were gonna need the National Guard
ON TV people are stil

You failed to kill the lawyer
Ive gotta get you off the bench

Bench Gamei
Come nightfall this city is mine

 Rules
Mr Fox Security is showing

Keep an eye out for me will you
Now what
Need someone to shake it for you

Hello
Dent
Jesus I thought you was dead
Half
Who picked up Rachel Wuertz
 It mustve been Maronis men
 Shut up
Are you telling me that youre gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordons unit
I dont know he never told me
Listen Dent I swear to God I didnt know
what they were gonna do to you
Thats funny
because I dont know
whats gonna happen to you either
Beautiful isnt it
Beautiful
Unethical
Dangerous
Youve turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone

And a highfrequency generatorreceiver
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city
With half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of Gotham
This is wrong
Ive gotta find this man Lucius
At what cost
The database is nullkey encrypted
It can only be accessed by one person
This is too much power for one person
Thats why I gave it to you
Only you can use it
Spying on 30 million people
isnt part of my job description
This is an audio sample If he talks
within range of any phone in the city
you can triangulate his position
Ill help you this one time
But consider this my resignation
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises I wont be
When youre finished
type in your name
My officers are going ove
every inch of the tunnels and bridges
but with the Jokers threat
theyre not an option
 And land routes east
 Backed up for hours
Which leaves the ferries
with 30000 ready to board
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island
The men you put away
Those arent people Im worried about
You should be
Whatever the Jokers planning
its a good bet Harveys prisoners are
involved I wanna get them out of here
So where is Harvey
 We havent found him
 Oh Jesus
How long can you keep this quiet
Dont stop for lights cops nothing
Going to join your wife
 You love her
 Yes
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die
Look take it up with the Joker
He killed your woman He made you
like this
The Jokers just a mad dog
I want whoever let him off the leash
I took care of Wuertz but who was
your other man inside Gordons unit
Who picked up Rachel
Must have been someone she trusted
Look if I tell you
will you let me go
Cant hurt your chances
It was Ramirez
 But you said
 I said it couldnt hurt your chances
Youre a lucky man
 But hes not
 Who
Your driver

Stand back
Hey that aint right

Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate

You choose
Oh and you might wanna
decide quickly
because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble
Stay back
Well now who are you to decide
We ought to talk this over at least
We dont all have to die
Those men had their chance
 We are not going to talk about this
 Why arent we talking about it
Theyre talking over the same thing

 Lets put it to a vote
Yes
 Hello

You live to fight another day officer

We found the missing hospital bus

Then we have a hostage situation
Its a shooting gallery
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows

We have clear shots on five clowns
Snipers take them out
smash the windows a team rappels in
Team moves in by the stairwells
Two three casualties max
 Lets do it
Its not that simple
 With the Joker it never is
 Whats simple is
every second those people on the
ferries get closer to blowing
 That wont happen
 Then hell blow both of them up
 We dont have time for paper ballots
 I want everybody to put their votes
on this piece of paper
If anyones got pens pass it along
Thank you Anybody else
Coming through Anybody else Thank you

We need to get these votes in quickly

Give it to me
These men will kill you
and take it anyway
No one wants to get their hands dirty

Those men on that boat
They made their choices
They chose to murder and steal
It doesnt make any sense
for us to have to die too
All the old familiar places

Stand by
Red team floor secure
Hostages are safe
Give it to me
You can tell them I took it by force
Give it to me and Ill do what
you shouldve did 10 minutes ago
We really should stop this fighting
otherwise well miss the fireworks
There wont be any fireworks
And here we go
What were you trying to prove
That deep down
everyones as ugly as you
Youre alone
Cant rely on anyone these days
You gotta do everything yourself Dont we
Thats okay I came prepared
Its a funny world we live in Speaking of
which you know how I got these scars
No but I know how you got these
Oh you
You just couldnt let me go could you
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force
meets an immovable object
You truly are incorruptible arent you
Huh You wont kill me
out of some misplaced sense
of selfrighteousness
And I wont kill you
because youre just too much fun
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever
Youll be in a padded cell forever
Maybe we could share one
You know theyll be doubling up the rate this
citys inhabitants are losing their minds
This city just showed you
that its full of people
ready to believe in good
Until their spirit breaks completely
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent
and all the heroic things hes done
You didnt think Id risk losing the battle
for Gothams soul
in a fistfight with you
No
You need an ace in the hole
Mines Harvey
What did you do
I took Gothams white knight
and I brought him down to our level
It wasnt hard
See madness as you know
is like gravity
All it takes is a little push
Dent
This is where they brought her
Gordon after your men handed her over
This is where she died
I know I was here
 trying to save her
 But you didnt
 I couldnt
 Yes you couldve If youd listened to me
If you stood up against corruption
instead of doing your deal
with the devil
I was trying to fight the Mob
You wouldnt dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what Id lost
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most
tell them its gonna be all right
when you know its not
Well youre about to know
what that feels like Gordon
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me youre sorry
 Youre not going to hurt my family
 No
Just the person you love most
So is it your wife
Put the gun down Harvey
Harvey put down the gun
Please Please Harvey Please
Oh goddamn it
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family
No
 We have a winner
No Jim stop him
Harvey
Dont let him
Harvey
Im sorry
For everything
Please dont hurt my son
You brought your cops
All they know is theres a situation
They dont know who or what
Theyre just creating a perimeter
You think I wanna escape from this
There is no escape from this
You dont wanna hurt the boy Harvey
Its not about what I want
its about whats fair
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time
But you were wrong
The world is cruel And the only morality
in a cruel world
is chance
Unbiased
Unprejudiced
Fair
His sons got the same chance she had
Fiftyfifty
What happened to Rachel wasnt chance
We decided to act
We three
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything
 It wasnt
 The Joker chose me
Because you were the best of us
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you
could fall
And he was right
Youre the one pointing the gun Harvey
So point it at the people responsible
Fair enough
You first
My turn
Harvey youre right
Rachels death was my fault
Please dont punish the boy
 Please punish me
 Im about to
Tell your bo
hes gonna be all right Gordon
Lie
like I lied
Its going to be all right son
Dad Daddy is he okay
 Thank you
 You dont have to thank me
Yes I do
The Joker won
Harveys prosecution
everything he fought for
undone
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harveys reputation
We bet it all on him
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down
People will lose hope
They wont
They must never know what he did
Five dead
 Two of them cops You cant sweep that
 No
But the Joker cannot win
Gotham needs its true hero
 No
 You either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
I can do those things
because Im not a hero not like Dent
I killed those people
Thats what I can be
No no you cant Youre not
Im whatever Gotham needs me to be
Call it in

A hero
Not the hero we deserved
but the hero we needed
Nothing less than a knight
shining

Theyll hunt you

Youll hunt me
Youll condemn me
Set the dogs on me
Because thats what needs to happen
Because sometimes
the truth isnt good enough
Sometimes people deserve more
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded

Batman
Batman
Whys he running Dad
Because we have to chase him
Okay were going in Go go Move
He didnt do anything wrong
Because hes the hero Gotham deserves
but not the one it needs right now
So well hunt him
because he can take it
Because hes not a hero
Hes a silent guardian
a watchful protector
A dark knight
